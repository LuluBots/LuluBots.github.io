Hey everyone! I’m **Lulu Zhao**, a robotics enthusiast and sci-fi dreamer from China, currently a senior in Artificial Intelligence at Beijing Normal University. My goal? To be a full-stack robotics researcher and also write some fun, imaginative sci-fi stories. I’ve been lucky enough to work on some awesome research projects with Prof. Nancy Pollard at Carnegie Mellon University, and I spent a semester at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, interning at the T Stone Robotics Institute. Right now, I’m on the hunt for a Ph.D. opportunity in robotics for Fall 2025. If you’re up for a chat, don’t hesitate to reach out!

## Projects and Collaborations

### Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) and Elasto-plastic Objects  
09/2024 -- Present  
**Advised by Prof. Kwok Wai Samuel Au, Prof. Xiangyu Chu**  
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
- Transferring well-trained models to new DLOs often fails due to diverse material properties.
- Proposed DLO Transformer: A pretraining framework for learning material-aware latent representations of DLOs.
- Designed a teleoperation interface based on Meta Quest 3 using Unity for efficient data collection.
- Refined state representation of elasto-plastic objects, developing a multi-camera system and applying 3D occupancy.

### Dexterous Manipulation of Foam Hand via Diffusion Policy  
06/2024 -- 08/2024  
**Advised by Prof. Nancy Pollard**  
Carnegie Mellon University
- Building a general policy for an anthropomorphic soft Foam Hand is difficult: Involves 23 degrees of freedom.
- Customized a teleoperation system with Gello (XArm) and Manus (Hand), integrating ROS2 for real-time control.
- Formulated diffusion-based policies with action chunking conditioned on visual and joint state inputs.
- Developed an imitation learning-based manipulation system for Foam Hand with robustness and generalization.

### Self-supervised Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)  
01/2024 -- 05/2024  
**Advised by Prof. Ting Zhang**  
Beijing Normal University
- Performed image retrieval based on a reference image and text describing modifications.
- Presented a dataset-building scheme that uses vision-and-language pre-trained (VLP) models on the fly.
- First to create a generic dataset of 1.74 million triplets to advance visiolinguistic reasoning research.
- First to introduce a generic benchmark of 5,000 triplets to promote research in CIR.
