My name is **Lulu Zhao**, and I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence with a focus on robotics and deep learning. If you are interested in my research projects, feel free to reach out to me.

## My Research Projects and Collaborations

#### **Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) and Elasto-plastic Objects**
*09/2024 -- Present*  
**Advised by**: [Prof. Kwok Wai Samuel Au](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/au-kwok-wai-samuel/), [Prof. Xiangyu Chu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xiangyu-chu/)  
*The Chinese University of Hong Kong*

- Transferring well-trained models to new DLOs often fails due to the diverse material properties of DLOs.
- Proposed DLO Transformer: A pretraining framework for learning material-aware latent representations of DLOs.
- Designed a teleoperation interface based on Meta Quest 3 using Unity for efficient data collection.
- Refined the state representation of elasto-plastic objects, developed a multi-camera system, and applied 3D occupancy.

#### **Dexterous Manipulation of Foam Hand via Diffusion Policy**
*06/2024 -- 08/2024*  
**Advised by**: [Prof. Nancy Pollard](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/index.html)  
*Carnegie Mellon University*

- Building a general policy for an anthropomorphic soft Foam Hand is challenging due to its 23 degrees of freedom.
- Customized a teleoperation system with Gello (XArm) and Manus (Hand), integrating ROS2 for real-time control.
- Formulated diffusion-based policies with action chunking conditioned on visual and joint state inputs.
- Developed an imitation learning-based manipulation system for the Foam Hand with robustness and generalization.
